example:
// tests/Feature/Products/ExampleTest.php...
it('has products', function (string $product) {
    expect($product)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with('products');

// tests/Feature/Products/Datasets.php...
dataset('products', [
    'egg',
    'milk'
]);

how?
'products' are found in the tests/Datasets/Products.php file
