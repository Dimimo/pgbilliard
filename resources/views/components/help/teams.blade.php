        At first, you will find this page boring. But it is actually very interesting and
        <span class="font-bold">important for Bar owners  and Captains</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        Let me explain...
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <span class="font-bold">Teams and where they play</span> are obvious. The number next to it are the number of
        players added to the team. In the future, it should be at least 4.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        Finally, the Captain and the contact number. If the Captain is not set or the Captain didn't fill in the contact number,
        the fall-back number you see is of the bar owner. In case you need to move a date, or you will be later than expected,
        you find who to contact on this page.
    </div>
    <div class="font-bold">For Bar owners and Captains</div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        Bar owners and Captains may notice a <x-svg.pen-to-square-solid color="fill-blue-600" size="4"/> sign next to some names.
        This means you have access to change what's underneath. For Bar owners that would be the information of the bar, the
        team(s) and the players of the team(s). Including who to appoint as a captain. Appointing the teams itself is done by an
        administrator as it is part of the schedule in the current Season.
    </div>
    <div class="font-bold">For Captains</div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        Captains (and Bar owners) can add who is playing in the team. I made it as simple as possible. Just read the
        instructions on the page if you have any questions. A mistake is very easily undone by the way. Except...
        if you unset yourself as a captain... Well, you get a warning before doing so.
        Removing a team player gives a warning as well. Anyway, it's easy to add or remove players.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
        <span class="font-bold">Players that are already in another team can not be selected.</span>
        If the player is new and not in the database, simply add a new player. Names have
        to be unique. Don't worry, a warning is given if the name is already in use. After creating a new user,
        you will receive an email with the data your new team member needs in order to log in and change their credentials.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-6">
        That's about it. Cheerio and <span class="font-bold">Have Fun!</span>
    </div>
    {{-- todo: remove this after the first 2025 season --}}
    <div class="italic">
        (some players in the proposed list are not with us anymore; at the startup of the new website I had no other choice
        but to add everybody from the previous database; this will change after the first 2025 Season)
