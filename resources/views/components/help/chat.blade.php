        The General Chat Room is a starting point. You can create other rooms, public and private. In a private room you
        will need to invite other people, if not you will be talking to yourself...

    <div class="mb-4">I consider sending invitation emails for private chats. Not implemented yet.</div>
    <div class="mb-4">Any room you create can also be deleted, together with all chat messages that may exist inside.</div>

        If you for some reason remove a participant, their messages are removed from the chat as well. Administrators have no
        access to private rooms. Unless invited.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">Public rooms have a list of participants as well. All you need to do is create at least one message.</div>
    <div class="mb-4">You can delete any of your own messages.</div>
    <div class="mb-4">It's a simple chat. For your convenience. If it gets popular, it will be expanded with more features.</div>
