        A day schedule it the <span class="font-bold">blueprint</span> for the daily billiard schedule. I noticed some people like
        the 'old' schedule and some the 'new'. They will be able to choose.
    </div>
    <div>
        Whatever schedule the captains choose, they can still move around the players as they agree upon. Again: these proposed
        schedules are only a blueprint to fill in the players.
    </div>
    <div>
        Of course, a schedule is independent of Seasons, Venues and playing dates.
    </div>
    <div>
        Any schedule is based on 4 players per 2 teams and 15 games. Additional players can be added on the day schedule
        agreed by the captains. If only 3 players show up, it's a problem for the captains. Not the schedule itself.
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="font-bold">Why different schedules?</span> There are now 2 in use for historical reasons. Some captains have their
        preferences. By proposing different schedules, it is up to the captains which Day Schedule they prefer.
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="font-bold">Some practicalities:</span>
    </div>
    <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
        <li>Each player should add up to 4 games</li>
        <li>
            If you want to <span class="font-bold">swap some games</span>, reset them to <span class="italic">--select--</span> first
            (there is a complex bug I can't pinpoint, but... read next...)
        </li>
        <li>
            If you do accidentally create a second game on a single game, set one
            to <span class="italic">--select--</span> to make it disappear
        </li>
        <li>The 15th (3rd double) is shown, just leave it empty or reset to empty</li>
        <li>Everything you change is immediately saved in the database</li>
        <li class="font-bold">Sometimes it crashes, just reload to page ü§ê</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="font-bold">
        Just make sure the status of each player is <span class="font-bold text-green-700">set to green</span>.
    </div>
    <div>
        Captains can still swap players around if they both agree. These schedules are proposals to simplify the daily schedule makeup.
