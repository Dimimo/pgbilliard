## About the Puerto Galera Billiard League

This is a hobby website for out billiard (pool) league in Puerto Galera, Philippines. You may use this software yourself, under 
the conditions that you mention the source on the bottom, as it is now. 

It is designed for a League with teams of at least 4 players and 2 teams. Each playing day has 15 games. Three rounds of singles 
and 3 doubles. The rules of billiard itself are not reflected into the code. 

The code is not versioned. There is only the **main repository**. Improvements will happen, the source code will have changes.

The website is build on top of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). The CSS styles are based on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)).
